This application is a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) simulation tool for Finite Element Method (FEM) models. Originally adapted from [FBG_SiMul](https://github.com/GilmarPereira/FBG_SiMul/blob/master/LICENSE) by [GilmarPereira](https://github.com/GilmarPereira), this software features inclusion of temperature variation emulation within the program. To start, the user can supply a raw data text file. Then, the user can render a simulated reflection spectrum of an array of FBG sensors in response to the following parameters:</br>
* Longitudinal Strain (Uniform and Non-Uniform)
* Transverse Stress
+ Temperature

### Considerations
Please email Ben Frey (freynben@gmail.com) with questions or with run-time issues.

Current known issues:
1. Instability when plotting spectral responses, sometimes leads to program crash.
2. Inability to exit from program on macOS, requires force quit.
3. Saving plot picture inconsistent functionality.
